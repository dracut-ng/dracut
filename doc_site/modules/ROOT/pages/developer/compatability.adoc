= Compatability

Expect compatibility preserved for

* dracut command line options
* kernel command line options
* dracut module names
* dracut module interface

Do not expect compatibility preserved for

* undocumented filenames and function names for dracut module implementations
* very old dependent binary versions (including udev and systemd)

Changes impacting compatibility are explained in commit messages and in the
NEWS file.

When possible dracut will follow a depreciation process, whereby for one
releases (and one releases only) dracut will preserve compatibility to allow
for migration.

The compatibility promise is primary towards end users and not towards Linux
distributions packaging dracut. Distribution packaging will need changes
time-to-time between dracut releases (e.g. as files gets added and removed).

== Dependencies

Dependencies for the generated initramfs:

* glibc or musl
* shell (bash and/or dash). Some features are only supported with bash.
* udev. Forks of systemd's udev and related tools are unsupported.
* switch_root, mount, blkid, kmod
